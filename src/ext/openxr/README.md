### Introduction

OpenXR is an interface defined by Khronos Group. Implementation of the interface is done by each VR headset vendor differently.

### Files

The used interface (headers in C language) is an older version because Pico doesn't support the latest one yet.
The Implementations are taken from the vendor specific SDKs.
