# PPSSPP-UWP
PSP emulator with full UWP (ARM)

Legacy support with min build 15035


## What is this?

This is the first test on my idea to create UWP storage manager

check out **UWP2Win32**

## What's new?

- You should be able to choose new Memory stick location (anywhere)
- You should be able to browse folder without any problem
- You should be able to navigate between folders internally
- You should be able to install homebrew (zip) from anywhere
- You should be able to use and type into text fields (even on touch devices)
- You should be able use network features like remote play
- You should be able to start games by launching the file directly
